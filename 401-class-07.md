## Python Scope

### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope

LEGB rule: stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in

- Local (or function) scope: the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression; names created in it are only visible from inside the function (scope created at function call NOT at function definition, so # of local scopes is equal to # of function calls, even with recursive)
- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope: special scope, referring to that of the enclosing or outer function containing an inner or nested function; names visible from code of enclosing and inner functions
- Global (or module) scope: top-most scope; contains all names defined at top-level of program or module; names visible everywhere in the code
- Built-in scope: special scope, created or loaded when script is run or interactive session opened; contains keywords, functions, exceptions, attributes built into Python; names visible everywhere in the code

### Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope

*general rule: nonlocal names can be accessed from inside nested functions, but cannot be modified or updated from there*

However, Python provides two keywords that allow for modification of gloabl and nonlocal name content:

- global
- nonlocal

#### The global Statement

A global statement can allow a list of names to be defined as global names.

- consists of `global` keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas (can also use multiple `global` statements with a name or list of names)
- all listed names in statement will be mapped to global or module scope in which defined

example:

```Python
>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
...
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
1
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
2
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
3
```

The above code block uses `global` to map the name `counter` in the function scope to the same name in the global/module scope, so changes to `counter` in `update_counter()` function will be reflected in the global variable.

*NOTE: use of global is considered bad practice in general, and ther are often better ways to write the code to achieve same desire results (i.e. writing self=contained function relying on local rather than global names).*

#### The nonlocal Statement

A nonlocal statement can allow a list of names to be defined as nonlocal names.

- consists of `local` keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas
- all listed names in statement will be mapped to nonlocal scope, referring to the same names in the enclosing function
- allows modification of nonlocally/outer defined variables from within the nested/inner function

Example:

```Python
>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```

Unlike global, nonlocal cannot be used outside of a nested/enclosed function
