# Notes on Diversity and Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

- What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The rise of personal computer use in U.S. homes.

- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It shapes the narrative, but also gives those socializing male a leg up on others when it comes to tech literacy and familiarity.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

1. The obvious takeaway regarding gender is that the share of female employees in tech industry is across the board less than the share of female members of the population.
2. The share of black and latino employees in the tech industry is abysmally low, while the share of asian employees is disproportionately higher.
3. There are only 2 black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

- When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they're led by commitments from the leaders of the company.

- Why do diverse companies perform better?

More varied perspectives allowing for greater creativity and innovation.

- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

If there are no women in the room when a product is designed, then there may be ways that the product will affect users who are women that the male designers would lot be likely to anticipate.

## Things I want to know more about

I'm curious to look at Code Fellows' diversity stats, it seems like they do relatively well at promoting diversity and inclusion in their enrollment/recruitment.
