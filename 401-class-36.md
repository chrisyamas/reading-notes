## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

From [this article](https://medium.com/@steve_45636/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6).

1. Take a few minutes, and let them know
   - "Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking."
2. Write down the steps of the solution
3. Write pseudocode first
4. Don't sweat the small stuff
   - example: “…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.”
5. Sit down. Be humble. Accept criticism without responding defensively.
6. Come prepared (put hours of practice in beforehand)
7. Review your work for algorithmic efficiency and correctness
