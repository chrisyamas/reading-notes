Node allows for JS to be run on the server. It is useful for building apps with real-time interaction (such as chat sites). It also accomodates API building with high-volume input and output of requests of server.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Acronum time again: JEELCS!

**Job** - be ready for the interview which often involves pair programming
**Efficiency** - it actually helps catch/prevent mistakes which saves time in the long-run!
**Environment** - ensures you're ready for a work environment that will definitely involved pair programming.
**Learning** - fellow students have a lot to teach us, we all have our own knowledge bases and strengths.
**Collaboration** - by working together, we can be more engaged and focused than when working alone.
**Social** - increases and flexes our muscles for building and maintaining crucial social skills!

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Efficiency is huge, catching errors is way easier with a second set of eyes. Silly spelling errors or syntax can cost so much time trying to find.

How does pair programming work?

There is a driver who types and a navigator who instructs the driver what to type/code/do.
