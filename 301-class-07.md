# Notes on REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding?

A developer who helped write the first web servers via HTTP, such that he is still named in protocol specifications.

- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Every programming language, database, and system has different ways of referring to nouns.

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Representational State Transfer, or REST.

- What does a GET do?

Retrieves data from a server to bring to the browser.

- What does a POST do?

Allows one system to add something to another system.

- What does PUT do?

Replaces something in another system.

- What does PATCH do?

A partial update.

## API Keys

As of time of this submission, I have my Geocoding and Weather Bit API keys but I'm still trying to figure out how to get the Yelp API and Movie DB API keys.

## Things I want to know more about

Interested in seeing REST in action.
