## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

A Caesar cipher is a simple shift of every left to a different letter by a set number of places in the alphabet.

When you don't know the shift number, you can use frequency analysis, known plain text, or brute force to solve it.

- frequency analysis: looking at the most commonly used letters in the coded message, and then checking them based on the most commonly used letters in the expected language
- known plaintext: if some part of the message is known (or at least suspected) then it can make it easier to solve the rest
- brute force: trial and error, taking the time to try out each of the possible shifts until one proves correct

The three key aspects of data encryption:

- encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift)
- decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques
