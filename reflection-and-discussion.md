## Markdown and GitHub Pages: A Love Story

GitHub is a free and convenient service for web hosting, available to anyone. By learning the proper syntax of Markdown (an intuitive formatting language used on GitHub, as well as other popular sites like Reddit) anyone can format the text and image content they wish to publish as a webpage. Then, once you've followed the step-by-step instructions for using achieving your text format, you can utilize pre-designed webpage templates provided by the GitHub Pages service. Once you've selected your preferred template, you're ready to publish! It's as simple as that! (Although you may have to wait a few minutes for your most recent content changes to be processed by their server--it is free afterall!)

#### Wanna learn a little bit of Markdown now?

It's super simple. For instance, if you wanted to **bold** a word or series of words, you would just put two asterisks, or `**`, at both the beginning and end of the word(s). To italicize, do the same but with only `*` before and after.

Markdown also has a hierarchy of headings built into it. There are six levels of heading size, each indicated by a pound sign. For instance, if you typed this into your Markdown file
```
# Largest
## Second Largest
### Third Largest
#### Fourth Largest
##### Fifth Largest
###### Sixth Largest
```

Then it would look like this:
# Largest
## Second Largest
### Third Largest
#### Fourth Largest
##### Fifth Largest
###### Sixth Largest

But that's just a little bit from what I learned. If you're interested in learning more, check out this comprehensive [article on Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or this [explainer on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
