## Markdown and GitHub Pages: A Love Story

GitHub is a free and convenient service for web hosting, available to anyone. By learning the proper syntax of Markdown (an intuitive formatting language used on GitHub, as well as other popular sites like Reddit) anyone can format the text and image content they wish to publish as a webpage. Then, once you've followed the step-by-step instructions for using achieving your text format, you can utilize pre-designed webpage templates provided by the GitHub Pages service. Once you've selected your preferred template, you're ready to publish! It's as simple as that! (Although you may have to wait a few minutes for your most recent content changes to be processed by their server--it is free afterall!)
