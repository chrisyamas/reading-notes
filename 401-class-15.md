# Notes on Trees

- Node: a Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- Root: the root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K: a number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left: a reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right: a reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge: the edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: a leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height: the height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
- Depth First Traversal: prioritizing going through the depth/height of the tree first
  - pre-order: `root >> left >> right`
  - in-order: `left >> root >> right`
  - post-order: `left >> right >> root`
- Breadth First Traversal: iterates through each level of the tree node-by-node; in K-ary, it moves down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for presence of left and right child
- Binary Tree: restrict the number of children to two (hence `left` and `right` children); "perfect" binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children (maximum width of perfect binary tree is `2^(h-1)` where `h` is height of the tree equal to `log n` where `n` is number of nodes)
- K-ary Trees: able to have more that 2 child nodes; `K` refers to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have
- Big O for Binary & K-ary Tree: time complexity for inserting or searching is O(n), i.e. traversing entire tree of n nodes/items; space complexity of O(w) where w is largest width of the tree
- Binary Search Trees (BST): type of tree that has some structure attached to it; nodes are organized where those with values that are smaller than the `root` are place to the left, and al values that are larger than the `root` are placed to the right
- Big O for BST: time complexity for insertion and search is O(h) where `h` is height (worst case means going through as many nodes as the tree is tall); in "perfect"/balanced tree `h` is `log(n)`, but in unbalanced tree is `n`; space complexity for BST search is O(1) --> not allocating any additional space
