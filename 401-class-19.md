## Regular Expressions in Python

`import re`

### Basic Patterns, ordinary characters for exact matches:

`pattern = r"Cookie"`

### Wild Card Characters, special characters:

- `.` A period. Matches any single character except the newline character
- `^` A caret. Matches the start of the string
- `$` Matches the end of string
- `[abc]` Matches a or b or c
- `[a-zA-Z0-9]` Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9)
- `\` Backslash
  - If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken (Scenario 1)
  - Else if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape character, then the \ is treated like any other character and passed through (Scenario 2).
  - \ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning (Scenario 3).
- `\w` Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.
- `\W` - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).
- `\s` Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.
- `\S` Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).
- `\d` Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
- `\D` Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
- `\t` Lowercase t. Matches tab.
- `\n` Lowercase n. Matches newline.
- `\r` Lowercase r. Matches return.
- `\A` Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.
- `\Z` Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.
  - TIP: ^ and \A are effectively the same, and so are $ and \Z. Except when dealing with MULTILINE mode. Learn more about it in the flags section.
- `\b` Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.

### Repetitions

- `+` Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.
- `*` Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.
- `?` Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time starting from that position.
- `{x}` Repeat exactly x number of times.
- `{x,}` Repeat at least x times or more.
- `{x, y}` Repeat at least x times but no more than y times.

### Grouping in RegEx

The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text.

example:

```Python
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group()) # The whole matched text
  print("Username:", match.group(1)) # The username (group 1)
  print("Host:", match.group(2)) # The host (group 2)
```

*Output would be:*
Email address: support@datacamp.com
Username: support
Host: datacamp.com

Another way of doing the same is with the usage of <> brackets instead. This will let you create named groups.

## shutil -- High-level File Operations

The `shutil` module includes high-level file operations like:

- copying files
- copying file metadata
- working with directory trees
- finding files
- archives
- file system space
