# Notes on Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and Keys

- What does .map() return?

An `<li>` element is returned for each array item that is addressed by the `map()` function as it loops through.

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

You could declare a separate variable and include it in JSX, or embed the expression in curly braces to inline the `map()` result.

- Each list item needs a unique ____.

key, often an ID from the data.

- What is the purpose of a key?

To identify the items that have been altered, removed, or added.

## The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator?

The `...` syntax which is a quick and simple way to alter arrays, combine objects/arrays, or "spread" arrays out into separate arguments in a function.

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

The spread operator can also use math functions, copy arrays, add an item to a list, or convert NodeList to an array (to name a few uses).

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```
const chris = ['c', 'h', 'r', 'i', 's'];
const yamas = ['y', 'a', 'm', 'a', 's'];

const chrisyamas = [...chris, ...yamas];

// The result of console.log(chrisyamas) would be an array that looks like:
// ['c', 'h', 'r', 'i', 's', 'y', 'a', 'm', 'a', 's']
```

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```
const lastName = ['y', 'a', 'm', 'a', 's'];
const fullName = ['c', 'h', 'r', 'i', 's', ...lastName];

// The result of console.log(fullName) would be an array that looks like:
// ['c', 'h', 'r', 'i', 's', 'y', 'a', 'm', 'a', 's']
```

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```
const nameObject = {name: "Chris Yamas"}
const dobObject = {dob: "09-16-1992"}
const colorPersonObject = {...nameObject, ...dobObject, favecolor: "purple"}
// The result of console.log(colorPersonObject) would be an object that looks like:
{ name: "Chris Yamas", dob: "09-16-1992", favecolor: "purple" }
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

- In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

Creates an `increment` function and passes in a parameter of `person` or `name` to be able to pass through the objects and know which person is being changed.

- In your own words, what does the increment function do?

Loops through an array (in this case it is looping through the `this.state.people[]` array, and has arguments within the `increment` function to update the count through an incrementing (`p.count++`).

- How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

With use of a function that targets the child components, in this case the developer is using `map()` in his increment function in terms of `let ppl = this.state.people.map`.

- How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

By using `this` such as `this.increment` or `this.props.increment()`.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to better understand the difference between what is being passed down and what is being passed up in the video example, I'm still a little confused on that.
