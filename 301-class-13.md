# Notes on More CRUD

## CRUD Basics

- Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

PUT

- Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

PUT and DELETE

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

- Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD involves the base level operations of handling records or data objects in a data repository. REST involves operating on representations of resoures that are identified by URLs (HTTP protocols). REST commands represent the CRUD principles that are seeking to be achieved.

- If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

First step would be to install packages, then create the router, then build out the routes for CRUD, build out the schema, and then send data into the database using the schema and model that was built.

## Things I want to know more about 

I did some additional reading that talked about express, dotenv, and cors but also mentioned helmet, so I'm interested to see what helmet does.
