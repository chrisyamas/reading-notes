use `width` and `height` on images to adjust size in CSS

`float` property can be used on images to align them, better than the `align` attribute

If you've made an image block-level, then you can use `text-align` property on the containing element to align the image, or use `margin property` attribute with values of left and right set to `auto`

`background-image` can be used to palce an image behind any HTML element

`background-repeat` property can have value of `repeat` which repeats it both horizonally and vertically, `repeat-x` for horizontal, `repeat-y` for vertical, or `no-repeat` for only showing image once.

`baackground-attachment` specifies if image should move or stay in one place during scrolling with values of `fixed` and `scroll`

`background-position` specifies where in browser window the background image should be placed.

`background` property is shorthand for all other background properties just discussed, with the properties needing to follow the order of color, image, repeat, attachment, position.

a **rollover** is when a user moves their mouse over an element, and CSS background properties can be used to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it.

when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a **sprite**.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) involves on-page and off-page techniques.

In every page of a website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find the site) can appear in order to improve its findability:

1. page title
2. url/web address
3. headings
4. text
5. link text
6. image alt text
7. page descriptions

You should learn about your visitors to inform your site content, such as:

- how many people are visiting the site?
- what are visitors looking at?
- where are visitors coming from?

You need to think about domain and web hosting as well.

To transfer code and images from computer to hosting company, you follow File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
