## How to use Random Module

### Random functions

- `random.randint()`: accepts two params, a lowest and highest number. Generates integers between the two, EXCLUSIVE of lowest number and INCLUSIVE of highest number
- `random.random()`: multiply it by upper bound of range you want random numbers from
- `random.choice()`: generate random value from sequence included in parens (used for choosing random elements from a list)
- `shuffle()`: shuffles the list in place to put it in random order
- `random.radrange()`: generates randomly selected element from the range(start, stop, step)

## What is Risk Analysis

- risk analysis: the process of identifying risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test

### Why use Risk Analysis

Possible risks to encounter in:

- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

Unavoidable risks:

- The time that you allocated for testing
- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
- Incomplete requirements

Points to follow and take care of:

- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting
- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas
- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use
- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

Risk magnitude indicators:

- High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.
- Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.
- Low: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

### Risk Identification

Different types/sets of risks to identify:

- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required
- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

### The perspective of Risk Assessment

- Effect: To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
- Cause: To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
- Likelihood: To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

### How to perform Risk Analysis

1. Searching the risk
2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
3. Measures for the risk identified

## Test Coverage

salient quotes:

- "Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests. If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100%" -- Martin Fowler

- "If a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect." -- Brian Marick

you're doing enough testing if:

- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, **and**
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
