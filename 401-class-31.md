# Notes on Docker

## A Beginner's Guide to Docker

### Linux Containers

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization. also known as “containerization,” it has become increasingly popular.

virtual machines --> homes
docker containers --> apartments

### Containers vs Virtual Environments

virtual environments can only isolate Python packages, we can’t run a production database or other services within virtual environments so compared to Docker containers they are far more limited.

### Install Docker

download the desktop app on our computer and create a free account

after install, run `docker --version` in terminal


### Hello, World

To confirm Docker installed correctly we can run our first command `docker run hello-world`

good command to inspect Docker is `docker info`

we need `ls -la` instead of `ls` because the container is stopped Only running containers will appear with `docker container ls`

### Images and Containers

- A `Dockerfile` is the recipe for a cake
- An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
- A `docker-compose.yml` says how to make the cake
- And the container is the actual, baked cake

### Images

If you are on a Mac, you can create a new `Dockerfile` on the command line using the touch command `touch Dockerfile`

In text editor, add `FROM python:3.7-alpine`

### Image Builds

To build or create image for the first time run `docker image build .` with the period at the end of the command

### Image Layers

image layering exists for two main reasons:

1. each image layer is immutable–unchanged–like a git commit, this helps ensure consistency when two developers build the same image
2. performance; Docker caches the steps in a Dockerfile to speed up subsequent builds. When a change is made to a step, all steps following it will be executed from scratch

so order matters in a Dockerfile

### Containers

Create new Django Project using Pipenv to install Django and enter virtual env shell

```Bash
cd ..
mkdir djangoapp && cd djangoapp
pipenv install django==3.0
pipenv shell
```

create example project

`django-admin startproject example_project .`

then runserver

### Dockerized Django

```Bash
touch Dockerfile
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Conclusion

- Docker is a way to run Linux containers
- Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
- Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
- Images are made up of one or more layers
- Containers are a running instance of an image
docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
- Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didn’t cover here).

## Django for APIs

- Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs.
- We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework.
- It always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.

**Takeaway: Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.**

[The article builds out a Library website with traditional Django and extends it into a web API with Django REST Framework](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)
