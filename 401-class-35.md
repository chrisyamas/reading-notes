# Notes on Graphs

- graph: a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges
- vertex: also called a node; is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
- edge: a connection between two nodes
- neighbor: adjacent node to another (i.e. are connected via an edge)
- degree: the number of edges connected to that vertex
- undirected graph: also known as bi-directional; one that does not move in any direction
- directed graph: also known as a digraph; every edge is directed, so the graph has direction (each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of which node should be referenced next)
- complete graph: when ALL nodes are connected to ALL other nodes
- connected graph: when all vertices/nodes have at least one edge (tree is a form of a connected graph)
- disconnected graph: when some vertices may not have edges
- cycle: when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself
- acyclic graph: a directed graph without cycles
- cyclic graph: a graph that has cycles
- adjacency matrix: representation of a graph through a 2-D array; if there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
  - each row and columb represents each vertex of the data structure
  - the elements of both the columb and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn't a connection
  - sparse graph: when there are very few connections
  - dense graph: when there are many connections
  - within an adjacency matrix, and undirected graph will always be symmetric; this is not the case for a directed graph
- adjacency list: the most comment way to represent graphs; a collection of linked lists or arrays that lists all of the other vertices that are connected
  - they make it easy to view if one vertex connects to another
- weighted graph: one with numbers (called weights) assigned to its edges
  - to represent in a weight matrix, set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths (or 0, or infinity sign, if no connection)
  - can include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex in the adjacency list
- breadth first graph traversal: similar to that of a tree (travel outwards, level by level, from root), except method needs to track whether a vertex has been "visited" before so as to prevent an infinite loop due to cycles (add each visited vertex to a `visited` set during traversal); the algorithm is:
   1. `enqueue` the declared start node into the Queue
   2. create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present
   3. `dequeue` the first node from the queue
   4. if the `dequeue`'d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to `visited` set and insert them into the queue
- depth first graph traversal: uses a stack to visit all children of given subtree; the algorithm is:
   1. `push` the root node into the Stack and mark as visited
   2. start a while loop that runs as long as the stack is not empty
   3. `pop` the top node off of the stack and check its neighbors
   4. if a neighbor hasn't been visited, push it onto the Stack and mark as visited
   5. repeat until the Stack is empty
- real world use of graphs: include GPS and mapping, driving directions, social networks, airline traffic, Netflix (for suggestions of productions)
