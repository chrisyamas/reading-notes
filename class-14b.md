# Notes on NYT Magazine article: What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

## Personal reflection

As both an aspiring tech professional and someone with a lifelong passion for improving interpersonal group dynamics through compassionate and empowering communication, I was thrilled to know that a tech giant like Google has invested into research to optimize their teams through such means.

The thesis of the article, and the results of Google's Project Aristotle, is that most crucial factor in determining the success and overall sustained productivity of a group is whether psychological safety is a group norm.

Psychological safety is comprised behaviorally of two primary components, referred to by psychological researchers as "conversational turn-taking" and "average social sensistivity".

The former component is characterized by a fairly equal ultimate distribution of speaking by each group member during conversations. In other words, no individuals regularly dominate/lead the conversation and no individuals regularly remain quiet.

The latter component is demonstrated by how well group members can assess the feelings and needs of others by assessing non-overt expressions of their face, voice, or other nonverbal forms. Essentially, group members can detect when others are happy or frustrated, and therefore in a better position to respond to them appropriately and address any unmet needs.

These components work together to both prevent and diffuse tension, as well as to ensure better workflow and higher morale. This all increases the 'group IQ': that quality that determines a group's capacity for success on any given project (that researchers set out to measure and detect how to optimize).

The anecdote of Matt Sakaguchi divulging the truth about his ongoing struggle with Stage 4 cancer illustrates a key approach for increasing the psychological safety of a group: leadership that demonstrates interpersonal risk-taking. Sakaguchi began cultivating a norm of psychological safety--the kind where no team member has to be afraid to speak up, be vulnerable, or share more of their whole selves with their coworkers--by taking the first step as the person in power to be vulnerable with his team. This 'softened' everyone up, brought down walls, and created a space for sharing by everyone.

The social space that results from such a step (followed up by steps like Sakaguchi's encouragement of sharing and open discussion from everyone else) is the kind that directly fosters "conversational turn-taking" and indirectly/gradually allows group members to understand each other well enough to allow for greater "social sensitivity".

This article, for me, further validated my choice to make a career pivot to tech (and made me even more eager to earn a role at Google eventually).
