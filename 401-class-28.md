# Notes on Django CRUD and Forms

## Django Tutorial Part 9: Working with forms

### Overview

- HTML form: group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect info from users to submit to a server
- they are flexible mechanisms for getting user input (suitable for many different data types):
  - text boxes
  - checkboxes
  - radio buttons
  - data pickers
  - and more...
- they are also relatively secure:
  - data sent in `POST` requests with cross-site request forgery protection
  - the Django Admin site itself provides a form for editing models

Working with forms includes many steps for developers:

- writing HTML for the form
- validating and santizing entered data on the server (also maybe in the browser)
- reposting the form with error messages in case user input is invalid
- handling successfully submitted data
- responding to user to indicate success

Django Forms simplifies all of these steps through its framework for defining forms and their fields programatically, and using those objects for generating HTML form code and handling input validation and user interaction.

### HTML Forms

[the article provides a refresher on HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms)

### Django form handling process

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
   - The form may contain blank fields if you're creating a new record, or it may be pre-populated with initial values (for example, if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
   - The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).
2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
   - Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.
3. Clean and validate the data.
   - Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input fields, such as removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server, and converts them into consistent Python types.
   - Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (for example, that they are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)
4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (such as save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, and so on).
6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

### Form

The `Form` class specifies:

- the fields in the form
- their layout
- display widgets
- labels
- initial values
- valid values
- error messages associated with invalid fields (once validated)

The class also provides methods for rendering itself in templates using predefined formats (like tables and lists, for example) or for getting the value of any element (which enables fine-grained manual rendering).

### Declaring a Form

Very similar to declaring a `Model`, shares same field types (and some similar parameters). Example:

```Python
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```

### Form fields

The arguments that are common to most fields are listed below (these have sensible default values):

- `required`: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
- `label`: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
- `label_suffix`: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal dateâ€‹:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
- `initial`: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
- `widget`: The display widget to use.
- `help_text` (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
- `error_messages`: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
- `validators`: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
- `localize`: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
- `disabled`: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.

### Validation

Example of adding validation:

```Python
import datetime

from django import forms

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

    def clean_renewal_date(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']

        # Check if a date is not in the past.
        if data < datetime.date.today():
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

        # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
        if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

        # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
        return data
```
