# Notes on Classes, Objects, Recursion, and Pytest

## Classes and Objects

- objects: encapsulate variables and functions into single entity
- classes: provide a template to create objects

### Accessing Object Variables

example of accessing variable inside newly created object "myobjectx":

```Python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```

Example of creating multiple objects of same class:

```Python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)
```

### Accessing Object Functions

Similar notation to accessing variable:

```Python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```

### init()

- `__init__()`: special function called when class is being initiated, used to assign values in a class:

```Python
class NumberHolder:

   def __init__(self, number):
       self.number = number
```

## Thinking Recursively in Python

An iterative algorithm is one based on explicit loop construction.

Recursive algorithms go a step further and dive the problem into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them.

### Recursive Functions in Python

- recursive function: a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions
- i.e. the function will call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result

Two parts to it:

- base case
- recursive case

Example (for calculating n! in Python):

```Python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)

# factorial_recursive(5) ---> 120
```

Under the hood, each recursive call is adding a stack frame with execution context to the call stack until base case is reached, then stack unwinds until each call's results are returned.

### Maintaining State

Given that each recursive call has its own execution context, state must be maintained by either:

1. threading state through each recursive call so the current state is part of current call's execution context
2. keeping state in global scope

THREADING example:

```Python
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)

# sum_recursive(1, 0) ---> 55
```

GLOBAL SCOPE example:

```Python
# Global mutable state
current_number = 1
accumulated_sum = 0


def sum_recursive():
    global current_number
    global accumulated_sum
    # Base case
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum
    # Recursive case
    else:
        accumulated_sum = accumulated_sum + current_number
        current_number = current_number + 1
        return sum_recursive()

# sum_recursive() ---> 55
```

### Recursive Data Structures in Python

A list is an example of recursive data structures (ones that can be defined in terms of smaller versions of itself)

Example of using empty list and `attach_head` operation to generate any list:

```Python
# Return a new list that is the result of
# adding element to the head (i.e. front) of input_list
def attach_head(element, input_list):
    return [element] + input_list


attach_head(1,                                                  # Will return [1, 46, -31, "hello"]
            attach_head(46,                                     # Will return [46, -31, "hello"]
                        attach_head(-31,                        # Will return [-31, "hello"]
                                    attach_head("hello", [])))) # Will return ["hello"]
```

Other recursive data structures are sets, trees, dictionaries, etc.

### Naive Recursion is Naive

INEFFICIENT recursive function to compute nth Fibonacci number:

```Python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

MORE EFFICIENT example by caching each computation's results:

```Python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

- lru_cache is a decorator that caches the results, thereby avoiding recomputation (since it uses dictionary for caching results, the positional and keyword function args must be hashable)

### Pesky Details

Since Python doesn't support tail-call elimination, a stack overflow can result if more stack frames results than the default call stack depth (can become an issue with deep recursion).

Treating Python's mutable data structures like immutable ones will negatvely affect space and garbage collection (GC) efficiency by unnecessarily copying lots of mutable objects.

## Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

### Fixtures

In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the `pytest.fixture` decorator, along with a function definition.

### Coverage

There's a package called pytest-cov on PyPI that you can download and install. Once that's done, you can invoke pytest with the `--cov` option.
