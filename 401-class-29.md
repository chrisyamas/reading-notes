# Notes on Hashtables

- Hash: a hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets: a bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions: a collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
- hashtable uses key value pairs, so every node or bucket has both a key and a value
  - it allows for a key to be stored, and the value to be quickly retrieved
  - hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that can be looked at directly to retrieve the value

- hash code turns a key into an integer
- deterministic: output is determined only by input (no randomness), same in same out each time

- collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array/list
  - a “perfect hash” will never have any collisions
- collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one
  - so if two keys resolve to the same index in the array then their key/value pairs can be stored as a node in a linked list
  - each index in the array is called a “bucket” because it can store multiple key/value pairs
