# Notes on JupyterLab and NumPy

# JupyterLab Overview

JupyterLab, according to the site, "is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter."

It's flexible, integrated, and extensible format enables work with documents and activities like Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components.

Right click and select a kernel in the text editor.

All popular image formats are standard in notebooks. PDFs and html are viewed easily. .JSON files can be edited, same with .VEGA.

Work easily with data and code. When you open, you're in command mode. You work in individual cells. There are keyboard shortcuts. Add cell above with a, below with b, copy with c, paste with v, cut with x, etc...

Edit mode happens when you press enter. Uses markdown for formatting/structure of font.

The whole notebook of cells is running on the same kernel, so variables can be reused and reassigned like in normal code files. Can run selections apart from entire notebook using shortcuts or options at the top dropdown of screen.

Documents and activities can be viewed side-by-side in split screen or tabs, and integration is achieved through:

- code consoles providing transient scratchpads for running code interactively (fully supporting rich output) and able to be linked to a notebook kernel to log computations, etc.
- kernel-backed documents allow code in any text file (i.e. Markdown, Python, R, LaTex, etc) to be run in any Jupyter kernel
- notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own table, alongside notebook, so simple dashboard with interactive controls can be backed by a kernel
- live editing of documents can be reflected in other viewers via multiple doc views with different editors (markdown, delimiter-separated values, vega/vega-lite)

## NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

NumPy is a Python data analysis package that can help speed up workflow and interface with other Python-related packages.

The tutorial uses data that is in ssv (semicolon separated values) format.

### Lists of Lists for CSV Data

Instructions:

- Import the csv library.
- Open the file.
- With the file open, create a new csv.reader object.
- Pass in the keyword argument delimiter=";" to make sure that the records are split up on the semicolon character instead of the default comma character.
- Call the list type to get all the rows from the file.
- Assign the result to appropriate name.

### NumPy 2-D Arrays

NumPy works with multidimensional arrays, like 2-D (which is a matrix). It's just a list of lists. Has rows and columns. Specifying row and column numbers allows elements to be extracted.

The [article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) goes on to give examples of:

- creating a NumPy array
- alternative NumPy array creation methods
- using NumPy to read in files
- indexing NumPy arrays
- slicing NumPy arrays
- assigning values to NumPy arrays
- 1-d NumPy arrays
- n-d
- NumPy data types
