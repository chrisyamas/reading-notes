# Notes on Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods

Special methods, predefined, to enrich classes in Python. They have the double underscores before and after the letters in the method name. Sometimes called "magic methods". Allows the mimicking of built-in methods (like defining `__len__()` for an object some `len()` can be called on it).

Dunder Methods allow for:

- Initialization of new objects with `__init__`
- Object representation with `__str__` and `__repr__`
- Iteration with `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__`
- Operator overloading (comparison) with `__eq__`, `__lt__`
- Operator overloading (addition) with `__add__`
- Method invocation with `__call__`
- Context manager support (with statement) with `__enter__`, `__exit__`

## Iterators

Two key phrases in Python's iterator protocol:

- first setting up and retrieving the iterator object with an `iter()` call, and then repeatedly fetching values from it via `next()`.

While they could exist in different classes, the responsibilities can also be merged into / shouldered by a single class.

The `StopIteration` exception can be used in the case of breaking out of infinite repetition involving interators.

Between Python 2 and Python 3:

- In Python 3, the method that retrieves the next value from an iterator is called __next__.
- In Python 2, the same method is called next (no underscores).

## Generators

- Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.
- The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it.
- Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement.
