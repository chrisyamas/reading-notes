# Notes on The Command Line

## The Command Line

Any quotes or images in this section are [from this article](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php).

### So what are they exactly?

Command line, or terminal, is a text-based interface to the system. Commands are entered by typing on the keyboard and feedback is given as text.

Example:

![Terminal Example 1](./401-class-00-img1.png)

In the above:

- Line 1 has the prompt `user@bash` followed by the `ls` command we entered, followed by the command line arguments of `-l /home/ryan` (all of which are followed by spaces). `-l` is also known as an option. Options typtically start with a dash and modify the command behavior.
- Lines 2-5 are the output from running the command.
- Line 6 presents the prompt again, awaiting a new command.

### Opening a Terminal

- On Mac: Applications -> Utilities -> Spotlight -> Terminal
- On Linux: Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities

### The Shell, Bash

The shell is the part of the operating system defining how the terminal will behave an display after running commands. The most common shell is bash (stands for Bourne again shell). Check which shell is in use with `echo` command.

### Shortcuts
