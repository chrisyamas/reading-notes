# Notes on Intro to Django

## Getting Started with Django

A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

templates: flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed

Django provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

The article goes on to discuss authentication, admin, internationalization, and security.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers
- open source

Funding comes from:

1. corporate sponsor
2. solo
3. non-profits

### Django Software Foundation

They maintain Django in a number of capacities. triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work

The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.

- Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community. Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss functioned as Django’s dual-BDFLs from 2005 until their retirement in 2014.
