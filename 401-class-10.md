# Notes on Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack

- push: nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- pop: nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped; when you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised
- top: this is the top of the stack
- peek: when you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack; when you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised
- isEmpty: returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false
- FILO: First In Last Out; means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack
- LIFO: Last In First Out; this means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack
- Push O(1): pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation, because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack
- Pop O(1): popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top; when conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user
- Peek O(1): when conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack
- enqueue: nodes or items that are added to the queue
- dequeue: nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised
- front: this is the front/first Node of the queue
- rear: this is the rear/last Node of the queue
- peek: when you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue; if called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised
- isEmpty: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false
- FIFO: First In First Out; means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue
- LILO: Last In Last Out; means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue
- Enqueue O(1): when you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action; done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation
- Dequeue O(1): when you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action; done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue
- Peek O(1): when conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue
