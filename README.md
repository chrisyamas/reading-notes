Notes on, and reminders for, growth mindset.

My name is Christopher Yamas (he/him) and you can find my GitHub portfolio page at https://github.com/chrisyamas

Growth mindset, to be, is an active embrace of the concept of brain elasticity. By recognizing that intelligence and talent is not a fixed constant, but rather a variable we can affect by devoting time, attention, and effort, we can remember that growth is highly attainable.

I can keep myself in a growth mindset by:
1. blah
2. blah blah
3. blah blah blah
