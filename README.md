## Notes on, and reminders for, growth mindset.

### Let's talk about ***Growth Mindset!***

Growth Mindset is an active embrace of the concept of **brain elasticity**. By recognizing that intelligence and talent is *not a fixed constant*, but rather a variable we can affect by devoting time, attention, and effort, we can remember that growth is highly attainable.

To quote the late and great Audrey Hepburn,
> Nothing is impossible. The word itself says "I'm possible."

I can keep myself in a growth mindset by:

1. Reminding myself that ***every challenge can be a growth experience*** (if I embrace it!)
   - In fact, the most frustrating challenges will be the best learning experiences...if I persist.
2. Finding ***inspiration*** in the success of others
   - Be motivated to get better, and even learn from those around me so I can get to their level!
3. ***Embracing feedback*** and constructive criticism
   - I cannot learn from my mistakes if I can't recognize them. Other people can see things I can't, so feedback is a golden opportunity for learning and growing.
