## Notes on, and reminders for, growth mindset.

##### Let's talk about growth mindset!

Growth mindset is an active embrace of the concept of brain elasticity. By recognizing that intelligence and talent is not a fixed constant, but rather a variable we can affect by devoting time, attention, and effort, we can remember that growth is highly attainable.

I can keep myself in a growth mindset by:
1. Remind myself that every challenge is a growth experience (if I embrace it!)
   - In fact, the most frustrating challenges will be the best learning experiences...if I persist.
2. Find inspiration in the success of others
   - Be motivated to get better, and even learn from those around me so I can get to their level!
3. Embrace feedback and constructive criticism
   - I cannot learn from my mistakes if I can't recognize them. Other people can see things I can't, so feedback is a golden opportunity for learning and growing.
